# Typescript-DataStructures
Simple practise both for resharping my knowledge on some data structures and typescript coding.

# Run and debug
To run this project ```cd``` into one of the folders and run ```yarn``` 
after that you need to compile typescript just run ```yarn build``` 
and than you can run code by entering ```yarn start```

Every data structre uses nodemon as default running engine so you can make changes while running.
